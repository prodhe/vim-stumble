# vim-stumble

If you are you using the Swedish Balans time registration system, you'd be
happy to hear that you can create transactional comma separated values files
according to their API. This little plugin will help you keep track of your
daily efforts in a compact and readable text-only way and then bulk load them
at once at the end of the day.

## Options for ~/.vimrc

### let g:stumble_user

`let g:stumble_user = "ABCXYZ"`

This username will be automatically included for every row. Set it to whatever
your login is in the live system.

## License

Free as in free beer.
